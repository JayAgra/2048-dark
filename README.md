A dark mode for 2048 <br>
I did NOT make 2048, this is just my improvements on <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli">gabrielecirulli</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048">2048</a>. Please see the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/master/LICENSE.txt">license</a> it came with.<br>
Note the electron app is not nearly complete at the moment. Still not built, still no binaries. I will keep building the web version before the native apps.
