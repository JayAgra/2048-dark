A dark mode for 2048 <br>
I did NOT make 2048, this is just my improvements on <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli">gabrielecirulli</a>'s <a href="https://github.com/gabrielecirulli/2048">2048</a>. Please see the <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gabrielecirulli/2048/master/LICENSE.txt">license</a> it came with.<br>
Note the electron app is not nearly complete at the moment. Still not built, still no binaries. I will keep building the web version before the native apps.
## Installing / hosting
To install 2048 locally, simply navigate to one of the releases and download the binary for your OS. <br>
To host this, upload the web directory of the code to your webserver. Separated branches coming soon for easy cloning.
## Tiles
Tiles go up to 131072! <br>
